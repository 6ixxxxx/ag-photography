        <p>
              Hi, My name is Augustine, 
              <br /> A Nigerian based photographer that takes great delight in capturing the genuine character and soul of the subjects and people I capture.
              <br />
              Born and raised in Enugu state. 
              Photography started out as a hobby with phones and then I decided to go pro. 

              I pay close attention to the details and this helps me to create exceptional images. 
              <br />
              Thanks for stopping by and Iâ€™m hoping we work together.
        </p>
